# BomberMan
This is the first commit for Readme file. This project is about Bomberman game developed by Tommy Liu by using UE4.

The project I develop so far has the basic features, which implements all the points that are mentioned in the 'Programming Test' sheet.

The whole project takes me about 25 hours to reach the current state.

For the next development, I will start working on the AI Player which can move itself depends on the game situation. The AI player will simply move to the nearest breakable wall and place the bomb.Then walk away from the explosion area. 

Also, I will create more maps that are created by the computer (procedural generated maps) and optimize programming and calculation.
